# Login App

Welcome to the Login App, a simple React application for user authentication. This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) and styled with [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) and [Tailwind Material](https://tailwindmaterial.com/). The form is powered by [React Hook Form](https://react-hook-form.com/) for seamless form management. Additionally, end-to-end testing is facilitated by [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/).

## Features

- Form validation with React Hook Form
- Responsive design with Tailwind CSS
- Material design elements with Tailwind Material
- End-to-end testing with Cypress
